## Proxy support

Since version 5.9.2 the installer and Wodby agent support proxy. For installer all is needed is to have `$HTTP_PROXY` environment variable on the host machine. After the installation (and optionally a reboot), you will need to patch the wodby agent to pass through the `HTTP_PROXY` (as `WODBY_HTTP_PROXY`) environment variable from the host machine:
```
kubectl patch deployment agent -n wodby -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"env":[{"name":"WODBY_HTTP_PROXY","value":"'$(echo $HTTP_PROXY)'"}],"name":"agent"}]}}}}'
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall Wodby's infrastructure (5.x) from your server simply execute following command as root:

```shell
wodby uninstall
```
