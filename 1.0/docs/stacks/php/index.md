# PHP stack documentation

!!! info "IMPORTANT"
    PHP stack is available for deployment only in Wodby 2. But you already can use it for local development with [Docker4PHP](local.md). You can [subscribe to our newsletter](http://eepurl.com/br01gH) to get the announcement email when we release Wodby 2 to the public.
